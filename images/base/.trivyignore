# GitHub CLI (gh) false positives
# The gh CLI binary v2.83.2 contains the fix for CVE-2024-52308 (fixed in v2.62.0),
# but Trivy reports a Go pseudo-version from the internal build info rather than
# the actual release version.
CVE-2024-52308

# The sigstore/timestamp-authority CVE is a transitive Go dependency embedded in
# the gh CLI binary. This can only be fixed by the gh CLI maintainers updating
# their dependencies. The vulnerability is a DoS via excessive OID or Content-Type,
# which has limited impact in the context of a dev container CLI tool.
